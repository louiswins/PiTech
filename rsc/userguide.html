1 Introduction</A>
</H1>
The goal of this software product is to simulate the use of a treadmill. The
program itself has three main sections, accessible by tabs:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Treadmill control, which allows you to control the virtual treadmill and
runner. This is described in sections <A HREF="#sec:control">3</A> and <A HREF="#sec:goals">4</A>,
</LI>
<LI>User Guide, which displays a copy of this user guide, and
</LI>
<LI>Workout History, which allows you to view the history of the runner over
the course of all workouts. This is described in section <A HREF="#sec:history">5</A>.

3 Controlling the Belt
</H1>

<P>
There are two main ways to control the belt: manual user control (the default),
and with a built-in profile.

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Manual user control, in which the user changes the speed and incline
manually as he is using the simulator. The simulated track adjusts according to
the updated changes and stay at those settings unless the settings are changed
again manually.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Preset workout, a particular pattern that the track follows. The system
automatically adjusts the speed and incline at preset intervals to follow that
particular pattern. There are a few different patterns that the system can
follow.

<P>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
The preset workout plans are a full-on, immersive workout. Therefore, to apply
or remove a program, the treadmill must be stopped.

<P>
In addition to controlling the belt, you can set goals for yourself.  When you
reach the goal, the program will automatically alert you in the <B>Message
Box</B>. For more information on setting goals, see section <A HREF="#sec:goals">4</A>.

3.1 Manual User Control
</H2>

<P>

<OL>
<LI>If you are already running under a preset workout plan, you will have to
stop the treadmill. Press the <B>Pause/Stop</B> button until the treadmill is
fully cleared.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Press <B>QuickStart</B>. The simulator belt will begin moving slowly at the
preset speed of 1.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>Change the speed</B> by editing the <B>Speed Control</B>. You can use
the <B>up and down arrows</B>, or enter the value directly into the <B>text
box</B>. The speed has a minimum value of 0 mph, and a maximum of 15 mph.  You can
adjust it in increments of 0.1 mph.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>Change the incline</B> by editing the <B>Incline Control</B>. You can
use the <B>up and down arrows</B>, or enter the value directly into the <B>text
box</B>. The inclination has a minimum value of 0%, and a maximum of 15%.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>When the treadmill is running, pressing <B>Pause</B> will result in the
belt slowing down and coming to a stop. The <B>QuickStart/Resume</B> button will
display <B>Resume</B>, and the <B>Pause/Stop</B> button will display <B>Stop</B>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>To resume the treadmill with the same speed and incline when paused,
press <B>Resume</B>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>If the user presses <B>Stop</B> while the treadmill is paused then the
treadmill will become stopped. When this happens, the speed and inclination are
both reset to 0, and any goals or programs are lost. Also, the
<B>QuickStart/Resume</B> button displays <B>QuickStart</B>.

3.2 Using a Preset Workout Plan (Automatic
Control)
</H2>

<P>
You can use a preset workout plan to let the simulator adjust the speed and
incline of the workout. You can still adjust the speed and incline manually
during the preset.

<P>
There are a few types of workout programs to choose from:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Cardio,
</LI>
<LI>Cross Country,
</LI>
<LI>Sprint, and
</LI>
<LI>Weight Loss.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>

<OL>
<LI>If you are already running under another workout plan, or if you are
running manually, you will have to stop the treadmill. Press the
<B>Pause/Stop</B> button until the treadmill is fully cleared.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Use the <B>Program Control</B> to select an available program.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>All controls in the manual user control, as described in section
<A HREF="#sec:manual">3.1</A>, are also available, but the treadmill will also automatically
adjust the speed and incline.

4 Goals
</H1>

<P>
Independent of the type of workout you choose, you have the option of setting
target goals. This is a useful option which will alert you when you have run a
certain distance, burned a certain number of calories, or run for a certain
length of time. You can set one of each type of goal at any given time.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00061000000000000000">
4.1 Setting Goals</A>

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Use the <B>Goal Selection</B> options to select which goal you will work
toward: a distance-, duration-, or calorie-based goal.
</LI>
<LI>Use the <B>Goal Target</B> inputs to enter your goal: for distance, how far
you want to run; for duration, how much time you want to spend running; or for
calorie, how many calories you want to burn.
</LI>
<LI>The value you pick will appear respectively in the <B>Distance</B>,
<B>Time</B>, or <B>Calorie Display</B> under <B>Target</B>. If there is no goal of
that type active, the <B>Target</B> will display zero.
</LI>
<LI>Press <B>Goal Run Start</B> to activate your goal.

5 Viewing Workout History
</H1>

<P>
The software stores a detailed history of your workouts and can display several
statistics to help you track your fitness over a period of time. In addition to
the information displayed in the <B>Treadmill Tab</B> (such as current speed,
average speed, current incline, or calories burnt), you can access a long-term
history of your runs. This information is available at any time from the
<B>History Tab</B>.
