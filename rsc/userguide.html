1 Introduction</A>
</H1>
The goal of this software product is to simulate the use of a treadmill. The
program itself has two main sections:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Treadmill control, which allows you to control the virtual treadmill and
runner. This is described in sections <A HREF="#sec:control">3</A> and <A HREF="#sec:goals">4</A>.
</LI>
<LI>Workout History, which allows you to view the history of the runner over
the course of all workouts. This is described in section <A HREF="#sec:history">5</A>.

3 Controlling the Belt
</H1>

<P>
There are two main ways to control the belt: manual user control (the default),
and with a program. With manual user control, you have full control over the
speed and inclination of the treadmill’s belt, while when using a program, the
software will control the speed and inclination.

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Manual user control, in which the user changes the speed and incline
manually as he is using the simulator. The simulated track adjusts according to
the updated changes and stay at those settings unless the settings are changed
again manually.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Preset workout, a particular pattern that the track follows. The system
automatically adjusts the speed and incline at preset intervals to follow that
particular pattern. There are a few different patterns that the system can
follow.

<P>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
The preset workout plans are a full-on, immersive workout. Therefore, to apply
or remove a program, the treadmill must be stopped.

<P>
In addition to controlling the belt, you can set goals for yourself.  When you
reach the goal, the program will automatically alert you in the <B>Message
Area</B>. For more information on setting goals, see section sec:goals.

3.1 Manual User Control
</H2>

<P>

<OL>
<LI>If you are already running under a preset workout plan, you will have to
stop the treadmill. Press the <B>Pause/Stop</B> button until the treadmill is
fully cleared.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Press <B>QuickStart</B>. The simulator belt will begin moving slowly at the
preset speed of 1.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>Change the speed</B> by editing the <B>Speed Control</B>. You can use
the <B>up and down arrows</B>, or enter the value directly into the <B>text
box</B>. The speed has a minimum value of 0 mph, and a maximum of 15 mph.  You can
adjust it in increments of 0.1 mph.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>Change the incline</B> by editing the <B>Incline Control</B>. You can
use the <B>up and down arrows</B>, or enter the value directly into the <B>text
box</B>. The inclination has a minimum value of 0%, and a maximum of 15%.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>When the treadmill is running, pressing <B>Pause</B> will result in the
belt slowing down and coming to a stop. The <B>QuickStart/Resume</B> button will
display <B>Resume</B>, and the <B>Pause/Stop</B> button will display <B>Stop</B>.
Also, a 5:00 timer will appear and start counting down. If <B>Resume</B> is
pressed before the 5:00 timer is up, the belt resumes with the same speed and
incline it had before Pause was pressed. If the timer runs out, then the
treadmill resets.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>To resume the treadmill with the same speed and incline when paused,
press <B>Resume</B>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>If the user presses <B>Stop</B> while the treadmill is paused, or if the
5:00 timer runs out, then the treadmill will become stopped. When this happens,
the speed and inclination are both reset to 0, and any goals or programs are
lost. Also, the <B>QuickStart/Resume</B> button displays <B>QuickStart</B>.

3.2 Using a Preset Workout Plan (Automatic
Control)
</H2>

<P>
You can use a preset workout plan to let the simulator adjust the speed and
incline of the workout. You can still adjust the speed and incline manually
during the preset.

<P>
There are a few types of workout programs to choose from:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Cardio,
</LI>
<LI>Cross Country,
</LI>
<LI>Sprint, and
</LI>
<LI>Weight Loss.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>

<OL>
<LI>If you are already running under another workout plan, or if you are
running manually, you will have to stop the treadmill. Press the
<B>Pause/Stop</B> button until the treadmill is fully cleared.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Use the <B>Program Control</B> to select an available program.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>All controls in the manual user control, as described in section
sec:manual, are also available, but the treadmill will also automatically
adjust the speed and incline.

4 Goals
</H1>

<P>
Independent of the type of workout you choose, you have the option of setting a
target goal. This is a useful option which will alert you when you have run a
certain distance, burned a certain number of calories, or run for a certain
length of time.

The software stores a detailed history of your workouts and can display several
statistics to help you track your fitness over a period of time. In addition to
the information displayed in the <B>Treadmill Tab</B> (such as current speed,
average speed, current incline, or calories burnt), you can access a long-term
history of your runs. This information is available at any time from the
<B>History Tab</B>.
